# hello-world
Starting something in hopes that it leads me to a lifelong fun experience. 
I am a high school student as of right now. I have been searching for careers and job types that associate best with my personality and interests. As I researched, I settled upon exploring game design, however to be more specific, I'm interested in game development to aid in making games better. Thus, I'm working with my very first project to hopefully catapult me into the world of gaming that I love very much.
